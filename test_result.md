# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      message: "✅ COMPANY REGISTRATION MULTI-STEP FORM TESTING COMPLETED: Comprehensive testing shows the Company Registration form is well-implemented and functional. KEY FINDINGS: ✅ Access Control working (admin can access /company/add), ✅ Multi-step form structure excellent (Step 1 of 5 with proper labels), ✅ Progress bar functional (20% Complete), ✅ Step 1 General Info working (company name, GST/PAN fields, employee count), ✅ Professional UI with Shadcn components, ✅ Form validation structure present, ✅ Auto-save to localStorage implemented. MINOR ISSUES: Checkbox interaction has some UI overlay issues, cascading dropdowns and later steps require backend master data APIs to be fully functional. OVERALL: The multi-step company registration form is professionally built and ready for production use with proper backend API integration."

      message: "🔍 MASTER DATA APIs COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED: ✅ SUCCESS: All 10 master data endpoints working perfectly with correct data counts. Cascading dropdowns (Technology->sub-industries, India->states, Maharashtra->cities) functioning correctly. File upload API working after permission fix. ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE: Company creation API failing due to model field mismatch - CompanyCreate model uses *_id fields but Company model expects base field names. Backend needs field mapping logic to convert between models. 📊 RESULTS: 14/20 tests passed (70% success rate). Master data infrastructure is solid and ready for frontend integration."

      message: "🔧 CONTACT LIST PAGE CRITICAL BUG FIXED: ❌ INITIAL ISSUE: Contact List page was experiencing critical React errors due to SelectItem components using empty string values, causing red screen error and preventing page rendering. ✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Radix UI Select.Item components cannot have empty string ('') as value prop. Multiple SelectItem components in filter dropdowns were using value='' which caused React runtime errors. ✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: Fixed all SelectItem components to use 'all' instead of empty string values and updated corresponding filter logic to handle the change. ✅ TESTING RESULTS AFTER FIX: Contact List page now loads perfectly with all components rendering correctly: Page title 'Contacts', description, Add Contact button, Filters & Actions section, data table with proper headers, search functionality, filter dropdowns (Company, Designation, SPOC, Decision Maker, Status), and navigation working.
